# weightless
Weightless is a simple rigid body physics simulation showing how cuboid objects behave in zero gravity. It's basically a more aesthetic and interactive demo of my [basic physics](https://github.com/george7378/basic-physics) project, with a few minor changes to the engine.

The **R** key resets and randomises the simulation, while the **Arrow** and **W**/**S** keys add some pseudo-gravity by accelerating the reference frame.
