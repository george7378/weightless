# weightless
Weightless is a simple rigid body physics simulation showing how cuboid objects behave in zero gravity. It's basically a more aesthetic demo of my [basic physics](https://github.com/george7378/basic-physics) project with a few minor changes to the engine.

The only control is the **R** key, which resets and randomises the simulation.
